        <h2><i>Albert Einstein-Theoretical physicist</i></h2>
        

<p>I was born Albert Einstein in 1879 in Germany. As a young man, I was fascinated by math and science. I studied physics and thought deeply about the nature of time, space, energy, and matter
    In my twenties I worked as a patent clerk while I researched and wrote my papers on special relativity and the photoelectric effect
<br><br>
My theory of relativity explained how motion can change measurements of time and space. My equation E=mc2 showed that tiny amounts of mass can be converted to huge amounts of energy.

                        <li>This paper explored the photoelectric effect, demonstrating that light can behave as both particles (photons) and waves. This work laid the foundation for quantum mechanics.In his research, Einstein investigated the behavior of light when it interacts with matter.</li>

                        <li>Einstein's theory of general relativity expanded upon the special theory, providing a new perspective on gravity.
